## tech constraints

1. All devices on the separate audio network, no firewalls 
2. As all devices were on the same LAN , the test didn't incorporate a lot of router or firewall hopping.
3. We used a buffersize of 64 (the lowest).

## things we want to check

1. Does the setup work with 5 people singing simultaneously.

## conclusions

1. 1 box has a lot of static noise, possibly due to bad microphone? Needs to be checked.
2. the sound is not really loud coming from the dynamic microphones
